# Object Iteration Practice

> IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SEO TEACHERS August 4, 2021: THIS IS THE ADVANCED LAB! The other one is easier - please start there!

> NOTE: This lab is designed to run in Glitch, not repl.it.

### The goal

In this lab, you'll start to deal with objects that organize data more clearly. We'll start with a list of favorite books, but each book is keyed to a person's name.

For example, to print Zara's favorite book, you'd use the code `console.log(favoriteBooks["zara"])`.

You'll see that this lab is split into two levels. Level 1 focuses purely on iterating over, and manipulating objects. Level 2 is a bit more advanced; only tackle it after you've completed all the challenges in Level 1. 

Level 2 still deals mainly with objects, but will also fold in arrays. You won't need to do too much with arrays here, except for accessing specific items, and we've given you some helpful tips to get you going. You are also encouraged to explore documentation for additional help. If this is your first time dealing with arrays, we encourage you to give these exercises a try, but don't worry if you initially find them confusing. You'll be diving into arrays in just a couple lessons, and can always return to these exercises afterwards. 

Open up iterate.js, code out solutions to the challenges, and run it to test your answers.
